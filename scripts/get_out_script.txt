Well, the thing I've been asking myself is ...
What kinda sick individual names a street Edgewood Way ...
and then put it half a mile away from Edgewood Lane?
Crazy.
Got me out in this creepy, confusing-ass suburb.
Serious though. I feel here like a sore thumb out here.
Alright man, alright, talk to you soon. See ya.
Okay, so this is the Rhine Ave.
It's like a fucking hedge maze out here.
Okay, let's see, east ...
Keep going straight, and then ...
I think he said the left on, what was that, Peacock?
Go straight, then left on ...
I just keep on walking. I don't do nothing stupid. Just keep on...
Fuck this, I'm going fucking go the other way I came.
Not today. Not me.
You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here. Man, I'm gone.
Come on. This is ... Help.
Quality over Quantity (QoQ) Releases
Get Out (2016)
You're so cute. How is it going over there?
Good.
You've got your toothbrush? - Yes.
Do you have your deodorant? - Check.
Do you have your cozy clothes? - Got that.
Can you give me a minute, Sid? We gotta pry something out of your dad.
What?
Do they know... Do they know I'm black?
No.
Should they?
It seems like...
something you might want to know ...
Mention.
"Mom and Dad, my uh, my black boyfriend will be coming up this weekend ...
and I just don't want you to be shocked because he's a blackman. "Black ...
You said I was the first black guy you ever dated? Yeah, so what?
Yeah, so this is uncharted territory for them.
You know I don't want to be chased off the lawn with a shotgun.
You're not going to. First of all, my dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have.
Like, the love is so real.
I'm only telling you that because he is definitely going to want to talk to you about that...
and it will definitely fucking suck.
But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else.
They are not racist.
I would have told you.
I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. Think about that for just two seconds.
I'm thinking.Yeah, yeah, yeah good.
I'm a grown man ... - No way.
You broke my cigarette.
Really? You just threw it out. - Not really.
That was a dollar. You basically threw a dollar out the window.
Well, that was a dollar you decided to spend on nicotine and tobacco.
Hold on, I've got to call Rod.
Don't, don't, don't do that.
Whasup?
Yo, you at work? - Yeah, yeah, I'm at work.
Look, look Chris, tell me this okay?
How can I get in trouble for patting down an old lady? It's standard procedure.
Gary just thinks if an elderly bitch is elderly, she can't hijack no motherfucking plane.
See, wait, wait, now, I know you're laughing.
I'm serious, man. The next 9/11 is going to be on some geriatric shit.
Look man thanks for looking after Sid this weekend. Remember no human food.
He's go, he's got IBS. - Damn, see give me some type of credit.
Okay, I don't forget shit. You do.
No, I accept your apology. It's all good.
How's little Miss Rosie? - It's okay. She rides.
Let me talk to him. - No.
I'd like to talk to him please?
Hold on, hold on.
Hi, Rod. - Look here, you know you picked the wrong guy, right?
Oh yeah of course I know that. This is all just a ploy to get you.
It's not too late for us. - Okay, okay, get your own girl.
It don't matter, because you never take my advice.
At what?
Like don't go to a white girl parents house.
What she doing, licking your balls or something?
Goodbye. - You know what I'm saying, Chris?
That bastard hung up on me.
You're jealous. - I'm not jealous.
I made you jealous. It's Rod. - I'm not jealous of Rod.
You okay? - Yeah, that scared the shit out of me, and you?
Yes.
Stay here. - What? What are you doing?
I don't know. I...
Well maybe it's gone you know...
So in the future, the number to call is Animal Control Services.
Yes sorry. I was just disoriented.
So you guys, uh, come out from the city?
Yeah, yeah. My parents are from the Lake Pontaco area. We're just heading up there for the weekend.
Sir, can I see your license, please? - Wait, why?
Yeah... I have a state ID.
No, no, no. He wasn't driving.
I didn't ask who was driving. I asked to see his ID.
Yeah, why? That doesn't make any sense. - Here.
No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him your ID because you haven't done anything wrong.
Baby, baby, it's okay. Come on.
Anytime there is an incident we have every right to ask... - That's bullshit.
Ma'am, the ...
Everything alright, Ryan?
Yeah, I'm good.
Get that headlight fixed. And that mirror.
Thank you officer.
What? - That was hot.
I'm not, I'm not going to let anyone fuck with my man.
I see that.
We're here.
That's the groundskeeper.
Are you ready?
Hi. - There's my little girl. Come here.
How are you? - I love you too. I've missed you.
This is my Dad, Dean. This is Chris.
Call me Mr. Armitage. - Of course. I...
I'm kidding. You call me Dean and you hug me, my man.
How are you? - Good. How are you?
We're huggers. - Yes.
This is my Mom. This is Chris.
Welcome.
Nice to meet you.
Your father is very excited. Anyway, yeah, Missy.
Come on in, please. Welcome to our house.
How was your drive in? - It was fine.
We actually hit a deer. - What? - Oh, nooo...
Was it dead? - Yeah.
Oh, that's horrible. Are you guys alright?
Yeah, it just shook us up. - Really?
Yeah, it came out of nowhere. We got it pretty good.
Yeah, it must have frucked you out.
Shit, frucking weird. But you know what I say?
I say, one down, a couple hundred thousand to go.
No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling you I do not like the deer.
I'm sick of it. They're taking over. They're like rats.
They're destroy the ecosystem. If I see a dead deer on the side of the road, I think to myself that's a start.
I don't even understand that. I'm sorry. - I'm just saying.
You know what? I am grateful for what you have done today. I don't like them.
We got that.
Yeah ... - You guys look so wiped out.
Yeah, yeah, a little.
so how long has this been going on? This, this thing?
How long?
Four months. - Four months.
Uh, five months, actually.
She's right. -No problem.
That a boy. Better get used to saying that.
I ... Please. I'm so sorry.
Oh yeah, I'm sorry. She's right. I'm wrong.
See?
Does he have an off button? This is exhausting.
No. I want to give you a tour.
They just ... - Can we unpack first?
You want to unpack? Before the tour?
This is Missy's office. She takes appointments in there.
She's a therapist, right? - Psychiatrist, yeah.
Yeah, it turns out people up here are just as messed up in the head as they are in the city.
This is Jeremy. This is Rose's little brother.
I've heard stories.
Yeah, I bet you have. He's studying medicine now. Wants to be just like his old man.
You'll meet him. - Alright, cool.
Picked these up in Bali.
That's pretty eclectic. I'm a...
I'm a traveler and I can't help it. I keep bringing souvenirs back.
It's such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture. Know what I'm saying?
Here, you're going to love this. My Dad's claim to fame.
He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.
Those were the ones where ... - Owens won in front of Hitler.
Yes, what a moment, what a moment. I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit.
This black dude comes along and proves him wrong in front of the entire whole world. Amazing.
Not great for your dad, though. - Yeah. He almost got over it.
Uh, that's the basement. We had to seal it up. There's some black mold down there.
My mother loved her kitchen, so we keep a piece of her in here.
Georgina, this is Chris. This is Rose's boyfriend.
Hi. - Hello.
The garbage goes under the sinks. And now for the ...
piece de resistance.
The field of play
I love it. The nearest house is across the lake.
Total privacy.
I know what you're thinking. - What?
Come on, I get it.
White family, black servants. It's a total clich.
I wasn't going to take it there. - Well you didn't have to, believe me.
Now, we hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents.
When they died I just couldn't bare to let them go.
But boy, I hate how it looks.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.
Best president in my lifetime. Hands down.
I agree. - Yeah.
So what do your parents do, Chris?
Uh, my Dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was like eleven.
Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die? - A hit and run.
That's horrible.
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. - You were young.
Actually I don't remember a lot from that time, so ...
Well that's okay, we don't have to talk about that.
You smoke you, Chris?
You Jonesing a little bit over there? - I'm quitting.
Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore.
That's okay, we're not judging. - But it's a nasty habit though.
You should have Missy take care of that for you. - How?
Hypnosis. She developed a method and I'm telling you it works like a charm.
Some people don't want strangers messing around in their heads, guys.
Listen, Chris, I thought it was total bullshit.
I smoked cigarettes for fifteen years and I loved every goddamn puff I took.
She puts me under once, the sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit.
Okay fall back, Dean. - It's a service we provide.
I'm good actually, thank you.
Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the get together.
Wait, holy shit that's this weekend? - Yeah.
What get together? - Ohhhh God.
Thanks Georg. It's a ... Rose's grandfathers .. party.
My Dad would throw a shin dig once a year. Get all his friends together...
bocce ball , badminton ...
Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this?
Well, it's the same day every year, sweetheart. - No it's not.
Um, actually it is. - Yes.
Is it really? - Yeah, that is completely wrong.
We just kept it up, because after they died, it felt like we'd keep them close to us.
They are still with us.
I just wanted a quick chill weekend. - Lots of fun.
Sorry. - Georgina?
I am so sorry. Look what I ... - That's okay.
Why don't you go lay down, just get some rest?
Yes. I think I will. - Good.
Oh, must be very ... - What's up, fam.?
Hey, Jer-bear.
Hi darling. - Hey, buddy.
Nobody answers the door around here?
Hey Rosie.
Why would I lie? - Love it.
Has she told you about her toenail collection?
What? - Oh my God.
She used to bite them off, suck on them and then save them in a jewelry box.
No I didn't, I do not know what you're talking about. - That is really disgusting.
I fucking hate you. - Okay, here's a good one.
Let me set the scene, it was our junior year.
Rose has a crush on this guy Conner Garfield. - No.
Conner Garfield. - No. Mom.
No, Jeremy, stop.
No. These are good, these are good. We got to ... I want to hear them. - Rose, where are your manners?
Our guest wants to hear the stories. Please. - Thank you.
So Conner is from my lacrosse team. Huge kid, like 6' 3". He's pretty dumb, right.
So we through this party ... - You through a party.
I think my parents were in Greece or something.
We raided their liquor cabinet, and we were all shit-faced, like fifteen of us.
Oh my god, tell me this isn't true, Rose.
I filled the liquor bottles with water ... let me finish
Go ahead. I'm curious. - Okay so I'm upstairs ...
hooking up with the hottest girl in the class, Jan Deely.
Do you realize you're coming off as like the world's biggest douchebag, right now, right?
So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right. So I open it ...
and blood's gushing from his mouth and he's screaming: "Your sister bite my fucking tongue off," right.
You bit him?
Okay, okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss and he slipped some tongue...
and I was not expecting it. It was a reflex. I'm sorry!
A reflex that I' have since gotten rid of.
Yeah, you better be careful. - Yeah, I'm going to be very careful now.
I'm going to get dessert. And Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit?
So Chris, what's your sport? Football? Baseball? - Basketball, mostly ...
Are you an MMA fan?
Dude. - Dude, what?
What?
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second?
You're dating my sister, right?
He's dating my sister. You had your chance.
I can't get to know the guy?
You mean like UFC?
Yes. - Yeah, no too brutal for me.
Have you ever gotten into street fights as a kid?
I did judo after school, first grade. You should have seen me.
Judo?
Because with your frame and your genetic makeup ...
if you really pushed your body ...
And I mean really train. No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast.
Carrotcake.
Carrotcake.
What have I missed?
A whole bunch of nothing. - We just talking about sports.
Right? - Yeah.
That sounds good.
So the thing about jiujitsu is...
that strength does not matter.
It's all about this.
It is a strategic game, like chess.
It's all about getting two, three, four moves ahead.
Cool.
Stand up.
Jeremy, no karate at the dinner table. - It is not karate, Mom.
Yo, I've got a rule: no play fighting with drunk people.
Not going to play? I just want to...
I wasn't going to hurt him.
He was going to put you in a fucking headlock.
What is his problem? He has never treated any of my boyfriends that way. Ever, ever, ever.
Oh my god and then my Dad, with his those "my man" stuff.
My man, my man. I don't think he's ever heard that or said it...
and now that is all he says.
Yep. -Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina? What the fuck was that about? That was so crazy.
I mean how are they different than that cop?
That's the fucking bummer of it all.
Anything, anything more you'd like to add.
I told you so.
I didn't want to say, I didn't want to say it, I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say it.
I don't like being wrong.
I've noticed that. - I am sorry.
No, no, no. Wait. Come here. - Sorry. This sucks.
What? Why do you say you're sorry?
Because I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.
No, it's fine.
Why are you so calm? - Honestly, this is nothing.
I like you and your racial flow
Is this a racial flow? - Racial.
Are you feeling a racial flow. - Yes, you feel racial flowing.
What? - The party.
How bad can that be? - They're so white.
Like so white. - It's all good.
You know, with my genetic makeup the shit goes down. I'm a beast.
Do you realize how dangerous smoking is?
Yeah.
Come in and sit with me, please.
Just for a moment, please.
Thank you.
So you're comfortable enough, right? - It's perfect. Thanks.
Sure.
Want to know how it works?
You dangle a pocket watch in front of people's faces? Is that it?
You watch a lot of TV. - When I was a kid.
Now you're feeling very sleepy.
We do use focal points sometimes to...
guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility.
Heightened suggestibility? - That's right, that's right.
Do you smoke in front of my daughter?
I'm going to quit, I promise. - That's my kid, that is my kid.
Are you interested?
What about your mother?
What about her?
Wait, are we ... - Where were you when she died?
I don't to think about that.
Home ... watching TV.
can you hear the TV?
What do you hear?
Rain. - Rain. It was raining.
Can you hear the rain?
Do you hear it? Find it.
Tell me when you've found it.
Come here, Chris, look at me.
I found it. - Where was your mom?
She uh...
She was coming home. She wasn't home.
From her work?
And what did you do?
Nothing.
Nothing?
I just sat there.
You Didn't call anyone? - No.
Why not?
I don't know, I just...
thought that if I did, it would make it real.
You're so scared.
Do you think it was your fault?
How do you feel now?
I can't move.
You can't move. - Why can't I move?
You're paralyzed.
Just Like that day when you did nothing. You did nothing.
Now...
sink into the floor.
Wait, wait, wait. - Sink.
Now you're in the Sunken place.
What's up man?
They working you good out here, huh?
Nothing I don't want to be doing.
I didn't get to meet you yet, up close. I'm Chris.
I know who you are.
She is lovely isn't she?
Rose?
Yes, she is. - One of a kind. Top of the line.
A real doggone keeper.
Right.
I'm sorry about last night. - What?
My exercise. I did not mean to scare you.
And did it work? - Did What work?
You were in Mrs Armitage's office for quite some time.
I guess I had too much of that wine last night. I can't really remember...
Well, I should get back to work and mind my own business.
I think your mom hypnotized me last night.
What? When?
I went out for, I went out for some air last night and I run into her...
and I can barely remember any of it but now the thought of a cigarette makes me want to throw up.
Oh my God.
I'm Sorry. I can't believe she did that to you.
And I had some fucked up dreams. - What did you dream?
I was in a hole or something and I could not move. It was like ...
God, That sounds terrible. I'm Sorry.
What's Walter's deal?
What do you mean his deal?
I just talked to the dude and his whole vibe is hostile. - Did he say something?
It's not what he says it's how he says it.
Maybe he likes you.
Maybe he's jealous or something. I...
Are you fucking with me? - No.
So you think I've got a chance?
Okay, you find that funny. - Do you have a good word?
Great, no, fine. - I will, I'm going to talk with my Dad about that. That is not...
No, don't talk to your Dad. It's fine. - No, that's not it.
It's fine, it's not a big deal. Forget about it. It's done.
Oh boy.
Oh man.
It begins. Are you ready for it?
Yeah, yeah. - Not me.
There they are. Marcia.
So nice.
Just laugh. - Laugh? Okay. How do you do that again?
Just smile all the time. Yeah, there you go. There it is.
oh Look, it's the Greene's.
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris. Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene.
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed. - Also.
Boy That's quite a grip. - Thank you. You too.
Do you ever play golf?
Once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good.
Gordon was a professional golfer for years. - Are you kidding?
Well I can't quite swing the hips like I used to though. But I do know Tiger.
Isn't That's great. - Super.
Gordon loves Tiger. - The best I've ever seen, ever hands down.
So Chris. Let's see your form.
This is Nelson and Alisa. - How are you doing?
Oh, How handsome is he?
Are you handsome?
Not bad, huh Nelson?
So, Is it true?
Is it better?
Fair skin has been in favor for the past what, couple of hundreds of years...
But now the pendulum has swung back. Black is in fashion.
Pardon me. I'm going to take some pictures. - Of course.
There he is.
Good to see another brother around here.
Hi. Yes of course it is.
Is something wrong?
There you are. Can you do something with this.
Hey. I'm Philomena. And you are?
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.
Fantastic. You two make a lovely couple.
Thanks. - Where are my manners? Logan. Logan King.
Chris just told me that he felt much more comfortable with my being here.
That's nice.
Logan, I hate to tear you away dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you.
Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris.
Goodbye.
What the fuck?
Ignorance.
Who? - All of them.
They mean well, but they have no idea what real people go through.
Jim Hudson.
- Chris.
I know who you are.
I am an admirer of your work. You have a great eye.
Wait. Jim Hudson? Hudson Galleries?
Believe me, the irony of being a blind art dealer, isn't lost on me.
How'd you do it?
My assistants describes the work to me in great detail.
You've got something.
The images you capture are so brutal, so melancholic.
Powerful stuff. I think.
Thank you.
I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly.
I have submitted to "Nat Geo" 14 times before I realizing I didn't have the eye.
I began dealing and then of course my vision went to shit.
I know. Life can be a sick joke.
One day you're developing prints in the dark room, the next day you wake up in the dark.
Genetic disease.
Shit ain't fair, man. - Oh you've got that right, shit ain't fair.
Come here.
What the fuck? You left me out there.
- Look at this.
She unplugged my phone.
- Who?
Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod and now I got no juice.
So you think she did that because...?
- Maybe she doesn't like ...
the fact that I'm with you
Really?
It's a thing.
So, you are so sexy that people are just unplugging your phone?
Forget it. Never mind.
- No, no stop. Don't ...
Don't do that. Don't ...
- It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. It's all good, right?
ah, they got you on display now, huh?
It's weird, man. And the people here too.
It's Like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for them.
yep you're in it
All full of shit, I didn't even want to tell you. - What?
I got hypnotized last night.
- Man get the fuck out of here.
No. Yo, yo, yeah it's to quit smoking. But Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so ...
Bro I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?
She can't fix my motherfucking life. You ain't getting in my head.
I know. She caught me off guard right, but it's cool because ...
I'm cured. It worked.
- Bro, Why are not you scared of this, man?
They could of had you doing all types of stupid shit. They could of had you barking like a dog...
flying around like you're a fucking pigeon, looking ridiculous, okay. Or...
I don't know if you know this. White people love making people sex slaves and shit.
Yeah I'm pretty sure they are not a kinky sex family, dog
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the shit our of niggers heads.
Okay? But that was after he fucked the heads.
Do you think they saw that shit coming? Hell no, okay?
They were coming over there like "I'm a suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls or shit
No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their heads was off their bodies.
Yeah they still sucked the dick, but without their heads. It was weird detached heads shit.
That was Jeffrey Dahmer.
Thanks for that image.
Hey man, I'm not making this shit up. I saw it on A & E.
That is real life.
Yo, and the black people out here too. It seems like they all missed the movement.
It's because they probably hypnotized.
Look bro, all I'm doing is just connecting the dots. I taking what you presented to me, okay?
I'm a tell you this. I think that mom is putting everybody in a trance and she's fucking the shit out of them.
Thanks, Rod. Bye.
Hello.
Fuck, hi.
I owe you an apology.
How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking.
Ah, No, it's cool. I was just confused.
Well, I can assure you there was no funny business.
Allow me to explain.
I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser...
and it accidentally came undone.
And rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way.
How foolish of me.
It's fine. I wan't trying to snitch.
Snitch?
- Rat you out.
Tattle tale.
Oh, Don't you worry about that.
I can assure you...
I don't answer to anyone.
Right.
All I know is sometimes, if there's too many white people I get nervous, you know?
Aren't you something.
That's not my experience. Not at all.
The Armitages are so good to us.
They treat us like family.
This bitch is crazy.
This bitch is crazy.
Hey, hang on. Chris, I want you to introduce you to some friends.
This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries ...
Hiroki Tanaka and Jessika and Fredrich Walden.
Too many names to remember, but hi.
Do you find that being African-American ...
more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world?
A tough one.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
They were asking me about the African American experience. Maybe you can take this one.
I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good.
Although I find it idifficult to go into detail ...
because I haven't had much desire to leave the house in a while.
We have become home bodies.
Yeah.
Yes, but even when we go into the city, I just have no interest.
The chores have become my sanctuary.
Get out.
Sorry, man.
Get out!
Yo chill...
Chill!
Seizures create anxiety, which can trigger aggression.
Yeah, but like randomly attacking other people?
- It's not random.
Yeah, It was your flash. That's what set him off.
How is he doing?
- Much better.
I imagine that I...
owe you all an apology.
No, no, no we're just very happy that you're yourself again.
Yes, yes I am.
And I thank God for you for calming me down.
I know that I must have frightened you all quite a bit.
Especially you, Chris.
I'm sorry.
The flash, I didn't know.
Of course not. How could you have?
But you shouldn't have been drinking either.
Well, I will have to let you all get on the rest of this night without my marvelous wit.
The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.
Why don't you just get some rest?
It was nice meeting you, Chris.
Something to lighten the mood?
Yes. Yeah, Let's get this party back on track.
How about sparklers and bingo?
We're going go on a walk.
- Are you sure?
Shall we?
My cousin's epileptic. That wasn't a seizure.
My Dad is a neurosurgeon and that is what he said it was.
I am inclined to trust ...
- That was not a seizure.
What was it then?
How long have you known that guy?
I met him today. Why?
This is going to sound weird, but ...
when he came at me ...
I felt like I knew him.
Like you've met Logan before? - No, not Logan, I knew the guy who came at me.
I think your mom got in my head, alright.
I think she got in my head...
Yeah, and it worked I thought.
- No, it did not.
She got in my head and now I'm thinking all this fucked up shit that I don't want to think about.
Like what?
I just need to go.
You want to go.
Hmm, mmm
Without me?
Whatever you want.
I told you about that night when my mom died.
When I didn't call 911 and didn't go out looking for her.
One hour went by, then two ... then three ...
and I just sat there.
I was just watching TV.
There was nothing you could have done.
- I later found out that ...
She had survived the initial hit.
She lay there bleeding by the side of the road, cold and alone.
That's how died in the early morning, cold and alone.
And I was watching TV.
There was time.
You were just a little kid. - There was time.
There was time.
There was a time when somebody was looking for her. There was time, nobody, nobody, nobody was looking.
You're all I've got. I'm not going to leave here without you. I'm not going to abandon you.
You're not?
- No, no I'm not.
Oh my God, you scared me.
Let's go home.
What?
Let's go home, this sucks.
This sucks. Let's go home. I'll make something up.
I love you.
Love you too baby.
Bye. - Come on, baby.
Good night, Chris. It was great to meet you.
Asshole.
That's Dre. - Dre ?
Andre Hayworth.
Used to kick it with Veronica? - Veronica from wh...?
Teresa's sister who worked at the movie theater on 8th.
Yeah, that is him. But wait, wait, wait...
This is so fucking, fucking crazy...
He's different.
- No shit!
Why is he dressed like that?
- It's not that. It's everything.
He came to the party with a white woman like 30 years older than him.
Sex Slave.
Chris, you've got to get the fuck up out of there, man. You are in some " Eyes Wide Shut " situation. Leave the motherfuck...
you gonna be a... Hello?
Chris? His battery must have fucking died.
Hey handsome. Are you packing?
- Rose, we've got to go, we got to go now.
Is everything okay?
I tell you in the car but we have to go right now. Okay?
Okay. Yeah. Let me go get my bag.
Are you ready? - Yeah, I was just looking for my camera.
It's right here.
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put the bags in the trunk real quick.
Yeah, They' are in here somewhere. It's just a matter of finding them.
Are you OK?
Take me second.
What you can't find those keys?
No. I can never find them.
- Let's do this on the move.
Chris ...
- Let's get the keys.
Yo man. -Where are you going? The party is just starting.
- I just put the bags in the car, man.
Would anyone like tea? - No I'm good. We leaving, actually.
Really? Why? Is there something wrong?
His dog got really sick, so he has to be at the vet first thing in the morning.
Sorry. - How terrible.
Rose, the keys.
- I'm looking.
What is your purpose, Chris?
What?
In life. What is your purpose?
Right now it's finding those keys.
Fire.
It is a reflection of our own mortality.
We are born, we breathe and then we die.
I'm looking.
Even the sun will die someday.
But we are divine.
We are the gods trapped in cocoons.
I don't know where they are.
Rose, give me those keys.
Give me those keys! Rose, now, now! The keys!
Whoa be careful bro.
- What the fuck?
I didn't do anything.
- What the fuck is going on?
Where are those keys, Rose?
You know I can't give you the keys right babe?
Come on.
Is he hurt? - Did you see him drop?
Yes I did. Jeremy, grab his legs, please. Take him downstairs. Dean, help him.
I can get him alone.
No, you can't, you've already damaged him enough.
- Okay, fuck.
Are you ready?
- Mind his head.
Careful.
You'll drop him.
- No, I'm not.
You're not get me looking...
Can I help?
- Okay, that was my fault.
You were one of my favorites.
You hear that, Chris?
One of her favorites.
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from the phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.
Hey, it's Chris, I'm either away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you. Peace.
Yeah. Me too.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
Millions of Americans feel the effects of aging.
Every movement puts pressure on your joints.
Over time, this wear can cause discomfort.
What happened to Andre Hayworth? He disappeared in Evergreen Hallow
Is there anything more beautiful than a sunrise?
I am Roman Armitage and if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on.
There's no need to worry. Let's take a walk.
You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you enjoyed your entire lifetime.
With your natural gifts and our determination we could both be part of something greater.
Something perfect.
The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle.
Our order has been developing it for many, many years ...
and it wasn't until recently it was perfected ...
by my own flesh and blood.
My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group.
Don't waste your strength. Don't try to fight it. You can't stop the inevitable.
And who knows?
Maybe one day you will enjoy being members of the family.
Behold ...
a coagula.
Fuck.
Hello, mister...?
- Williams. Rod Williams.
TSA? - Yes Ma'am.
Well, You know all TSA issues should be brought up with the authorizing officer.
Yes, ma'am, but this is not a TSA business.
Don't the hell call me "ma'am." Because we not going to get along.
How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?
Alright, here it is.
My boy Chris has been missing for two days.
Your son is missing?
- No. Not my son. My friend. He 26.
His name is Chris, Chris Washington.
He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.
She is white.
Alright, go on.
- Look, Chris was supposed to come back on Sunday, right?
And I been watching his dog, Sid.
That's Sid.
- Cute, right?
So Chris sent this to me from his girlfriend's parent's house .
You see? That's Andre Hayworth.
Okay? Someone we knew back in the day.
Apparently he has been missing for six months in some affluent suburb.
He don't look so missing to me.
- That's because we found him. Right?
But Chris says he's acting real different.
Different How?
This dude is from Brooklyn. Huh, He don't dress like this.
I didn't used to dress like this.
Plus he is married to a white woman twice his age.
And that would explain the clothes. Alright.
Rod Williams, TSA.
I know, I know, I know, but I'm trying to work towards this.
Look, What I'm about to tell you going to sound crazy. You ready?
Try me.
- I believe they've been abducting black people ...
brainwashing them, making them work for them as sex slaves and shit.
Sorry about the shit. Sorry.
Hold on a second.
Then he sent some me some weird picture, and I like, 'Oh man, that's Andre Hayworth. "
This dude been missing for six months, right?
So I do all my research you know because as a TSA agent, you know you guys are detectives, I've got the same training.
We might know more than you all sometimes because we dealing with some terrorist shit, so ...
But that's a totally different story. So I go do my detective work, right?
and I start putting pieces together and see this is what I came up with.
They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves...
or sex slaves, not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit.
See I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making them slaves or whatnot...
but all I know is they already got two brothers we know and they could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already.
What's the next move?
And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothing for you.
Oh White girls, oh they get you every time.
Magic ain't real.
None of this shit makes sense.
Hello?
Hey, Rose? It's me, Rod.
- Hi.
Where is Chris?
He left two days ago.
- He left?
Yeah. He got all paranoid and then he freaked out on me.
And then he just got in a cab and left his phone.
Wait. You haven't seen him?
- No, he never came back here.
I've been calling his phone a bunch of times. Matter of fact, I even went to the police.
What did you say?
- I just said he was missing.
Oh Good. You ...
Let me ask you something.
What cab company did he use to leave?
Oh gosh, I...
I don't know. I guess maybe a local one or I guess he could have called an Uber.
Wait, I am so confused.
oh sh...You confused? oh sh...okay confused, you something know, me too.
Could you hold on one second? Hold on.
You lying bitch. She is lying like a motherfucker. I know that...
Whew that TSA shit tingles. This motherfucker is lying.
Okay, I got you. I'm going to record your ass.
I'm going to record the shit out of you. You talk too goddamn much. You're gonna say something.
Record.
Speaker.
Unmute.
So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him.
Rod, just stop.
I know why you're calling.
- Why is that?
It's kind of obvious, don't you think?
What?
That there is something between us.
No, what you talking about girl? I called you about Chris.
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.
What the fuck? No, Chris is my best friend.
Hey look, If you did something to him ..
- I know you think about fucking me, Rod.
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you. Why would you say some stupid shit What the...
You ass. I didn't want to fuck you. Bye.
God, she's so ... she's a fucking... She's ... God, She's a genius.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Hey, Chris. How's it going, buddy?
You can answer, there is an intercom in the room.
Where is Rose?
- Oh, You dirty dog.
You're one of the lucky ones, trust me.
Jeremy's wrangling method sounds much less pleasant.
I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions or concerns you may have so far.
Apparently our common understanding of the process ...
has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure.
You could give a shit, right? Okay, just let me just tell you what it is?
Phase one was the hypnotism. That's how they sedate you.
Phase two is this. Mental preparation. It is basically a psychological pre-op.
Pre-op?
- For stage three.
Transplantation.
Well, partial, actually.
The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put...
keeping those intricate connections intact.
So you won't be gone. At least not completely.
A sliver of you will still be in there somewhere. Limited consciousness.
You'll be able to see and hear ...
What your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger.
An audience. You will live in ...
- The Sunken Place.
Now you're in the Sunken Place.
Yeah. That's what she calls it.
Now I will control the motor function, so I'll be ...
Me.
You'll be me.
Good, good.
You got it quick. Good on you.
Why us?
Why black people?
Who knows?
People want to change. Some people want to be stronger ... faster ... cooler.
Black is in fashion.
But please don't lump me in with that, you know I could give a shit what color you are.
No, what I want is deeper.
I want your eye, man.
I want those things you see through.
This is crazy.
Okay, I'm done.
Asshole.
You ...
Come on.
One Mississippi, two Mississippi ...
three Mississippi, four Mississippi ...
911. What is your emergency?
- I'm in the house Armitage. My name is Chris.
I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?
I'm in ... I'm in the Armitage ...
No, no, no don't do it. I just wanna go.
Grandma
You ruined my house.
Get him grandpa
Let me do it.
I'm so sorry.
It's me.
I love you.
I love you.
Help.
Help me.
I told you not to go in that house.
I mean...
How did you find me?
I'm TS motherfucking A.
We handle shit.
That's what we do.
Consider this situation ...
fucking handled.
